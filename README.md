Abstract

Without a doubt, stock markets are an important and necessary part of any country's economy. However, the impact of stock markets on a country's economy may differ from the impact of stock markets on other countries' economies. This is due to the impact of stock markets on the economy being determined by several factors, including the organization of stock exchanges, its relationship with other financial system components, and the country's governance system, for example. All these variables are unique to each country. As a result, the impact of stock markets on the economy of a country is distinct. The Indian capital market system has undergone major fundamental institutional changes over the years, resulting in lower transaction costs, increased efficiency, transparency, and safety. All these changes have resulted in the economy's development through stock markets. Therefore, high demand for stock market development is expected. The current paper and visual technology will help to predict the future stock prices based on previous stock data and analyse the stock data. And we are going to help others to understand and easily invest in the stock market with the help of our visualization and it can also help them to predict the data with the data visualization done by Tableau and python.
